Problem Statement:

Determine what you want to achieve. It could be optimizing routes, reducing congestion, improving passenger flow, or understanding travel patterns.
Collect data on metro lines, stations, connections, and transit schedules.
Clean the data for inconsistencies, missing values, or errors.
Create visual representations of the network, such as route maps, passenger flow charts, or heat maps of station congestion.
Analyze how effectively the network handles passenger traffic and meets operational targets.

Solutions:

GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS:(Visualization)

First I used folium in python for geospatial analysis of how far the routes of the delhi metro are distributed.
I identified the unique values of line colours using pandas unique() function and create a for loop used to iterate over all the row in the dataset.
And save it as a html file.


TEMPORAL ANALYSIS:(Visualization)

Here are the other analysis like,
           
  1.How many number of stations are opened each year.
  
  2.What is the total and average distance between each stations from the start
  
  3.In which grade the layout of the metro stations are located.
